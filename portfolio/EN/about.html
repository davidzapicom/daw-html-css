                <p>Camp Whichaway was founded in 2010 and remains White Desert's signature luxury camp, accommodating 12 guests in a manner unmatched in Antarctica, hosted by a team that includes award-winning chefs and UIAGM-qualified mountain guides.
                    Whichaway is located in the Schirmacher Hills of East Antarctica, on a virtually ice-free rocky plateau that is home to more than 100 freshwater lakes. 
                    <br><br>
                    For those who assume Antarctica is a barren, frozen wasteland, Whichaway is an extraordinary reminder that the continent is home to a unique biosphere. Petrels, terns and skuas are often seen, and Adelie penguins nest within a few hundred meters of the camp.
                    Conditions there are relatively mild - at least by Antarctic standards - with average daily temperatures during the season of -5ºC.</p>

                <p>How do you logistically manage a luxury camp like this? <br> <br>
                    Very complex logistics. We share the charter of an Antarctic science vessel to transport some of our equipment and supplies. We have incredible teams of staff with sometimes unmatched polar expertise who drive tracked vehicles to get our supplies to the various camps.
                    Whenever we can, we use several aircraft to fly supplies and the occasional scientist to their science bases. We work very closely with the British Foreign Office on all our permits to carry out complex logistics in a safe and environmentally friendly way, to ensure we minimize our impact on this continent.

            <p>Being innovative means creating something new. We have created a new way to travel and experience Antarctica.  Establishing a green operation on the most hostile and remote continent the Earth has to offer requires constant innovation.
                Building a blue ice rink in Antarctica took many years of research, luck and hard work. On a continent with no tents, we had to transport every nut, bolt, bed, bed, cup, food and glass beaker by ship or cargo plane.
                The two White Desert camps are the height of ecological innovation.
                <br><br>
                But both are very different from each other.  They offer two distinctly different opportunities to experience the natural majesty - and the unique opportunities for adventure and inspiration - that only Antarctica can offer, and both offer White Desert's unparalleled and distinctive level of customer service and accommodation.
                Both camps respond to the needs of clients who crave different and more radical life experiences, with the breathtaking backdrop of Antarctica offering the opportunity to genuinely reconnect with nature in a way that no other place on Earth can match.
                When was White Desert launched?
                I founded it with my husband Patrick in 2005.
                How does White Desert differ from other companies when it comes to Antarctic travel?
                We wondered why only scientists and the occasional polar explorer, who happened to be around, got to see the true interior of Antarctica. We wanted to safely and responsibly show the interior of the white continent to a very small number of select guests to help create a corps of Antarctic ambassadors who would take home the memories and passion for this special place and help preserve this continent for future generations.

            <p>White Desert is the first company in the world to offer a luxury private jet service to Antarctica. Guests can stay at our flagship luxury White Desert Whichaway camp - the only luxury camp in Antarctica, with high-tech, eco-friendly cabins that sleep up to 12 people - or at our new Wolf's Fang camp.
                <br><br>
                            This camp is a more off-the-grid explorer camp than Whichaway, and is located near the White Desert Ice Rink. Wolf's Fang has a mountainous backdrop that provides a dramatic and impressive contrast to Whichaway's location near the coast.
                            <br><br>        
                            Activities at Wolf's Fang include hiking and climbing on nearby ridges, peaks and nunataks (the rocky summits jutting out from mountains covered almost entirely with glacial ice), as well as overnight ski touring expeditions to nearby glacial valleys, and tours on high-end mountain bikes equipped with studded snow tires.
                            <br><br>
                            Accommodations at Wolf's Fang are in seven heated and insulated tents, which offer guests the opportunity to experience a taste of old-world explorer life in 21st-century luxury.
